# Occupancy grid map SLAM

Using imu, encoder and lidar data collected from a robots to recover the trajectory of it and obtain corresponding occupancy grid map from 
time to time based on `Particle Filter` model. <br>
Then use the figures captured from a RGBD camera to texture the map using the `depth coorespondence` model<br>
