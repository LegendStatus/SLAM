# SLAM
This project intend to do color segementation to detect the blue barrel in the image. Some of the results are shown in ./Results. 

Two approaches are provided: EM and Softmax

First use Label.py to hand-labeled the barrel and splitting them into three labels, then using the mix_Gaussian.py to learn the model and finally show the results.
