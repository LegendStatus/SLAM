# This project intend to do color segementation to detect the blue barrel from the image and obtain its segmented figures. Some of the results are shown in [Results](/Results). <br>

## The approach to the solution is : EM Algorithm

## First use Label.py to hand-labeled the barrel and splitting them into three labels, then using the mix_Gaussian.py to learn the model and finally show the results.
